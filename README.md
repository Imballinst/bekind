> ✨ Bootstrapped with Create Snowpack App (CSA).

What You See Is Only The Surface (WYSIOTS) is a small interactive site, built with the hope so people will consider it's not always a happy story behind every smile.

## Available Scripts

### npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### npm test

**⚠️ NOTE:** Vue 3 testing support is still in progress. This template does not ship with a test runner.

### npm run build

Builds the app for production to the `build/` folder.
It correctly bundles Vue in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### Q: What about Eject?

No eject needed! Snowpack guarantees zero lock-in, and CSA strives for the same.
